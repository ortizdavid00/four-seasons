# Four Seasons Weather App

Four Seasons is a weather application that pulls data from an API (Open Weather Map) and displays the current weather based on geolocation.

1. The user has the ability to change the temperature display from celsius to farenheit by clicking on the temperature itself.
2. If the user denies to share the geolocation, the application will display an error stating that the use of geolocation was denied
3. The application changes the icons based on the current weather and time of day (day/night)
